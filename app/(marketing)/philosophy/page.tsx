          <p>
            I'll tell you a bit of my obsession with Japanese culture, the samurai code, and honor.
            I love how those warriors had incredible respect for the art of war and their core tenets of
            Bushid≈ç. Dishonor or failure could lead to seppuku (ritual suicide), a way to preserve or
            restore one's honor.
          </p>
          <p>
            So you'll see a few designs with Japanese samurai in them. I'm sure you know my animal spirit
            being a wolf. Loyalty‚Äîfiercely devoted to the pack, similar to samurai loyalty to clan or lord.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instinct &amp; Intuition‚Äîwolves rely on their sharp instincts, much like a samurai trusting their
            training and bushid≈ç to guide their actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Courage‚Äîwolves face danger head-on to protect the pack. A true warrior trait.
          </p>
          <p>
            Freedom &amp; Independence‚Äîwolves value their freedom but still thrive in structured packs like the
            disciplined but personally honorable samurai.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strength in Solitude and in a Pack‚Äîthe lone wolf and the pack dynamic reflect a samurai‚Äôs dual
            ability to act alone or with an army.
