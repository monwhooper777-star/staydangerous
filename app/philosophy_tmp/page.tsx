            I'll tell you a bit of my obsession with Japanese culture, the samurai code, and honor. I
            love how those warriors had incredible respect for the art of war and their core tenets of
            Bushidō. Dishonor or failure could lead to seppuku (ritual suicide), a way to preserve or
            restore one's honor.
          </p>
  
          <p>So you'll see a few designs with japense samurai in them.</p>
  
          <p>
            Im sure you know my animal spirit being a wolf. Loyalty Fiercely devoted to the pack,
            similar to samurai loyalty to clan or lord.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Instinct &amp; Intuition Wolves rely on their sharp instincts, much like a samurai
            trusting their training and bushidō to guide their actions.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Courage Wolves face danger head-on to protect the pack. A true warrior trait.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Freedom &amp; Independence Wolves value their freedom but still thrive in structured packs
            like the disciplined but personally honorable samurai.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Strength in Solitude and in a Pack The lone wolf and the pack dynamic reflect a samurai’s
            dual ability to act alone or with an army.
